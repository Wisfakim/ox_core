## Installation

Refer to our [documentation](https://overextended.github.io/docs/ox_core/) for installing and setting up ox_core on your server.

## Database

Only [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/downloads/) is officially supported.
We cannot guarantee older versions of MySQL will work as expected, and guarantee MySQL 8 is incompatible.

## Third-party resources

We ask that any resources you create _do not use the ox prefix_.
Doing so adds confusion about the resource creator and can lead to multiple resources existing with the name (i.e. ox_banking).

## Sample usage

Refer to [ox_core-example](https://github.com/overextended/ox_core-example) for some sample code. This should give some idea of how to use player and vehicle refs.
